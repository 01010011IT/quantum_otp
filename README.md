Quantum OTP Generator is implemented using Qiskit, a Python library for quantum computing. The project generates a One-Time Pad (OTP) utilizing the principles of quantum superposition and entanglement, providing enhanced security compared to classical OTP systems.

generate_otp Function:

Creates a quantum circuit with Hadamard gates.
Measures the quantum state to produce a binary output.
Converts the binary output into a decimal OTP result.

conver_to_decimal Function:

Converts a binary string into a decimal OTP result in 10K Shots!.

OTP Generation and Storage:
Generates and validates unique OTP results.
Saves OTP results to a local file (otpDataBases.txt).
Files:
otpDataBases.txt: Stores generated OTP results.
